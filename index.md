## Welcome

Hello! My name is Xiaolu Guo and I am currently postdoctoral researcher in
MIMG, QCBio at UCLA, advised by Prof. [Alexander Hoffmann](https://www.signalingsystems.ucla.edu/). My major research interests lie at the intersection of computational mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and system biology, focusing on developing and parameterizing mathematical models of signaling and gene regulation networks that govern immune responses to pathogens and cytokines. 

### General Interests

My interest lies in dissecting the stochastic processes present in
biological systems, with a special emphasis on ... My approach is a fusion of
statistical physics, mathematics, and computational techniques, all
aimed at elucidating the deterministic and stochastic dynamics that
dictate molecular interactions from a semi-analytical perspective.

I received my B.S. in the Department of Mathematics at Nankai
University. I finished my PhD at Peking University, advised by Prof. Lei Zhang, Prof. Hao Ge, and Prof. Weinan E. 

During my undergraduate years, I worked with Prof. [xx (ex)](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/qizhi/) on the single-molecule biophysics
topics. I worked as both a theorist and an experimentalist, and
developed a strong interest in the stochastic processes that occur in
biological systems. 

At UCLA, my work is focused on .

I am also interested in the development of computational tools to aid
in the analysis of biological data, with a particular flavor on
inferring first principles from experimental data using a top-down
approach.
